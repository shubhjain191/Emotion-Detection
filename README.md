# Emotion Detection Using Bidirectional LSTM

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements an **Emotion Detection System** using **Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)**. The model is trained on textual data to classify emotions expressed in text, helping in sentiment analysis and emotional intelligence applications.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Preprocessing of text data (tokenization, stopword removal, padding)
- Implementation of BiLSTM for sequence modeling
- Training on labeled emotion datasets
- Emotion classification (e.g., Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral, etc.)
- Model evaluation and performance metrics visualization
  

 ## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- The dataset consists of labeled text data where each sentence is tagged with an emotion.
- Common datasets include:
  - **ISEAR (International Survey on Emotion Antecedents and Reactions)**
  - **GoEmotions (Google's emotion dataset)**
  - **Custom-labeled datasets** https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kfbLovjS2KXTk5Dghz3JhhnDhIiFx_y7
